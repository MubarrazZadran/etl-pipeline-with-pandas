# etl-pipeline-with-pandas
Python ETL pipeline that extracts Olympic medal data from the web, cleans and transforms it using Pandas, and saves the results for visualization.

#Project Description:
This project demonstrates an End-to-End ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and Pandas. The pipeline extracts raw Olympic medal data from the web, cleans and transforms it into a structured format, and saves the final dataset as a CSV file for further analysis and visualization.

#Key Features
Extract: Scrapes Olympic medal data from an online source using the requests library.
Transform:
Cleans missing values
Splits athlete names into First Name and Last Name
Reorders and formats columns
Load: Exports the clean dataset into a CSV file.
Visualization: Creates a Plotly Pie Chart to show Olympic gold medals by country.
